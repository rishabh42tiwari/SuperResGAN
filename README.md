# 🖼️ SuperGenGAN Image Enhancer

A React-based web application that improves low-resolution or blurry images using a retrained **SuperGenGAN** (ESRGAN-based) machine learning model.

This project combines a modern React UI with powerful image super-resolution models to produce sharp, high-quality results from degraded images.
