## 📦 Pretrained Models


Available models:

| Model Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **RRDB_ESRGAN_x4.pth** | Final ESRGAN model used in the project. |
| **RRDB_PSNR_x4.pth**  | PSNR-oriented model optimized for high PSNR performance. |

> **Note:** Models were trained using the **MATLAB bicubic downsampling kernel**.  
Different kernels may introduce artifacts.
